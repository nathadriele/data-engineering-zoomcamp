## Data Engineering Zoomcamp

The Data Engineering Zoomcamp provides core concepts, tools, and practical skills needed for modern data engineering. The course covers a wide range of topics, from containerization and infrastructure as code to advanced batch and streaming processing. With a hands-on, project-based approach, the program ensures participants not only learn the theoretical aspects but also gain practical experience by building real-world pipelines.

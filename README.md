## Data Engineering Zoomcamp

The Data Engineering Zoomcamp offers essential concepts, tools, and hands-on skills required for modern data engineering. Covering a broad spectrum of topics — including containerization, infrastructure as code, and advanced batch and streaming processing — the course takes a practical, project-based approach. This ensures that participants not only understand the theory but also apply their knowledge by developing real-world data pipelines.
